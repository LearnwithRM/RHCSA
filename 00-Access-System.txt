Edit Text Files from the Shell Prompt
=====================================

Edit Files with Vim
-------------------

	Vim is an improved version of the vi editor, which is distributed with Linux and UNIX systems. Vim
is a highly configurable and efficient editor that provides split-screen editing, color formatting, and
highlighting for editing text.

Benefits of the Vim Editor
--------------------------
	The key reason to learn Vim is that it is almost always installed by default on a server for editing
text-based files.
	When a system uses a text-only shell prompt, you should know how to use at least one text
editor for editing files. You can then edit text-based configuration files from a terminal window
or remote logins through the SSH command or the Web Console. 
	You also do not need access to a graphical desktop to edit files on a server, and that server might not 
need to run a graphical desktop environment.
	Vim is also used often as the vi implementation on other standard operating systems or
distributions. For example, macOS currently includes a lightweight installation of Vim by default.
So, Vim skills that are learned for Linux might also prove useful elsewhere
